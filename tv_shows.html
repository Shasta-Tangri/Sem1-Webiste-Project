		<h2>The Classics</h2>
		<p>What makes a classic a classic, anyway? What’s classic to me, at 25, is different than what my grandmother would call a classic. So consider this classics through the eyes of a millennial. </p>
		<p>Friends. I think we can all agree that Friends is a classic. So why didn’t I watch it until 3 years ago? 6 white 30 somethings trying to make it in the big city. Okay Big Bang Theory, I hear you. Does that mean in 20 years we’ll call BBT a classic? Yikes. There are 10 seasons of Friends, having aired it’s first episode back in 1994. The series follows Monica, a high strung chef, her brother Ross, a paleontologist with a lesbian ex-wife, and their friends Chandler, a neurotic salesman, Joey, an out-of-work actor, Phoebe, a loopy guitarist, and Rachel, a serial romantic. </p>

		<h2>5. Shameless</h2>
		<p>This show is aptly named; they truly have no shame. If the holidays bring up memories of crazy family members and catastrophic events in the past, find comfort in Shameless knowing that someone else’s family is definitely worse than yours.</p>
