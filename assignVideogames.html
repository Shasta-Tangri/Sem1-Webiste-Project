			<h2 class="headers" >Final Fastasy 14 online</h2>
			<p class="ffxiv_text">The big think about final fantasy thats different from other mmo's is that the dev team actually listens to the feed back from players. With the waves of content they do, with every patch
			brings some type of new raid(with alliance raid being 24 man) also making new classes ideas never gets old. It's also a game that make crafting used in an mmo which WOW and other mmo's kinda moved away from in the
			newest expansions. The crafting is fun and interactive with little mini-games for fishing and other proffessions. Overall coming from an old WOW raider Final Fantasy hits all the checks for what we've been trying to get
			blizzard to do for years. Review on the lastest expansion from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-xiv-endwalker-review-ffxiv">IGN</a> (10/10. Solidified as my all time favorite video game. I cried so many times and that is rare for me. 7 years and almost 268 days played and what a pay off, while 
			still leaving me wanting more in the future. Thanks to the dev team.), (I agree with the more mature, and therefor darker, storyline being the way to go. Endwalker shies away from the "everything will be alright" mindset 
			and focuses on a real world full of real people with complex choices and problems. The queue has sucked, but during the time I have been playing on my main, the story has not disappointed at all. And the new areas are freaking gorgeous.)</p>

			<h2 class="headers" >World of Warcraft</h2>
			<p class="ffxiv_text">War of Warcraft(WOW) is been on a down side since Wraith of the lich king in my eyes, with some small victories for the game like legion and a few other small things. The new expansion shadowlands started off
			on neutral ground with everybody, but not taking the input from the complants they quickly put WOW back into it bad products for expansions. All they have to do is listen, but blizz doesn't even want to do that. 
			They also keep putting more and more daily quests that are mandatory, and no one wants that.I predict the whole franchise is going to go down. Review on the game from <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-shadowlands">metacritic</a>
			(unbalanced,one shot pvp classes, pay to win pvp. chinese mmorpgs grinding. maw is frustrating and unnecessary beyond first time in. matchmaking system is broken. pve loot and weekly rewards mostly rng. one of the three worst expansions. blizzard team you suck. quit now.), (Looks pretty as always. The time gating is 
			just too obvious currently. If you are trying to be a sweaty player this game is for you as you can level alts quickly. Punishing the slow player that likes to enjoy the process is modern day WOW's moto it seems. Waiting for changes to fix issues 
			is fine for free-to play games but this is a subscription based game. Requiring players to pay for inept design choices does not fly in this tight economy. Lowered my score. If you don't have dedicated M+, rated BG, Arena groups or a raiding guild 
			you will be suboptimal probably until the end of the patch.)</p>

			<h2 class="headers" >Guild Wars 2</h2>
			<p class="ffxiv_text" >Guild wars 2 or Gw2 series has been around for years, and has been really fun to play everytime I go back. But the downside to the game is I don't have a clue what to do in the endgame in it, like you go through this beautiful story and zones and finish it to 
			sit there and be like what do I do now. It's one of the mmo's where I really like the Pvp and combat of the game too, the 5 on 5 capture zones pvp I think was really great addition to the series and makes pvp interesting to everybody not just the hardcore
			people that play it everyday. Like I said before the storyline and the overall on zones of the game are beautiful and the story is great(every story starts slow intorducing everybody new). Reviews on the game from <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/guild-wars-2">metacritic</a>(Over my three accounts in this game, I have easily spent over 1,500 hours 
			and I don't regret it a bit. This game is absolutely charming and wonderful.), (So, is Guild Wars 2 the MMO messiah everyone is waiting for? Maybe not. What it is, though, is the first MMO in years that really does the "massively multiplayer" part justice. This is a gigantic, sprawling 
			world for explorers, with countless wonderful stories and characters, all backed by a gameplay concept that treats all players as equals. And that's just the basis of what Guild Wars 2 is.)</p>
