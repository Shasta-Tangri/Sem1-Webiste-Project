				<h2>Featured Metal Artist:</h2>
				<h2 class="ifTitle">In Flames</h2>
				<p class="content">In Flames is a Swedish melodic death metal band, founded in Gothenburg in 1990 by Jesper Strömblad. 
				They were founded around the same time as At The Gates and Dark Tranquility, and the three of them 
				became the founding fathers of the melodic death metal genre. In their time they’ve released thirteen 
				studio albums, three live albums, and seven EPs. Their debut was in 1994 with the studio album Lunar 
				Strain, which nowadays is quite divisive among the fanbase. It also wasn’t until their following 1996 
				album, The Jester Race, when they established much of their main lineup for years to follow. For the 
				recording of The Jester Race, vocalist Ander Fridén and drummer Björn Gelotte both joined the band. To 
				this day, although Gelotte switched from drums to guitar after Jester Race, those two are the members 
				of the band that have been their the longest. Today, their lineup consists of Fridén, Gelotte, rhythm 
				guitarist Chris Broderick, bassist Bryce Paul, and drummer Tanner Wayne.</p>
				<p class="content">In 2010, founding guitarist Jesper Strömblad announced his departure from the band due to alcohol 
				abuse issues. Strömblad’s departure from the Gothenburg group was amicable, due to his issues. However, 
				his departure created a large rift in the fanbase – larger than what was there before. Fans of the band 
				are largely segmented into three groups: the “Classic Era”, from 1994’s Lunar Strain to 2000’s Clayman, 
				the “Transitional Era” from 2002’s Reroute To Remain to 2008’s A Sense Of Purpose, and finally “Modern 
				Era”, from 2012’s Sounds Of A Playground Fading to present day(their most recent album being 2019’s I, 
				The Mask). Of course, there are also people that like all or most of their works as well, but the most 
				vocal among fans are those of the Classic Era.</p>

				<h2>Featured Punk Artist:</h2>
				<h2 class="osTitle">The Offspring</h2>
				<p>The Offspring are an American punk from Garden Grove, California, formed in 1984 by guitarist and 
				vocalist Dexter Holland. The next year, lead guitarist and backing vocalist Kevin “Noodles” Wasserman 
				joined the band. According to some stories, they only let him in at the time because he was old enough 
				to purchase alcohol, while the rest of the group was underage. They released their first demo album in 
				1986, simply titled 5 Songs. They also released another one later that year, this one titled similarly, 
				except it was 6 Songs. In 1989 they released their first album, a self-titled which received lukewarm 
				reception – only really garnering the group a cult following, mostly in their hometown. It wasn’t until 
				two albums later, 1994’s Smash, that the group really made their debut. Following albums received similar 
				reception, especially with such strong singles such as Gone Away, Pretty Fly (For A White Guy), 
				The Kids Aren’t Alright, and Why Don’t You Get A Job?. Their current lineup consists of Dexter Holland, 
				Noodles, and bassist Todd Morse. They are currently searching for a replacement drummer after their former 
				drummer refused to get vaccinated.</p>
				<p>In the years they’ve been active, The Offspring have released ten studio albums, two compilation albums, 
				five EPs, six demo albums, and three video albums. The most notable of those releases is easily 1994’s 
				Smash, which was a smash hit with the public. Songs like Come Out And Play, Self Esteem, and Bad Habit 
				are still iconic to this day. The album was among the most successful punk rock albums in the year it 
				released, right next to Green Day’s Dookie. And the album has inspired several musicians since it’s release, 
				as well as helped to push punk back into the mainstream during a time in which it was fading. In November 
				2019, they started their Canada wide tour in Halifax, Nova Scotia, with the help of Canadian punk band Sum 41 
				and English rock band Dinosaur Pile Up. Now in January 2022, the second show of their new Canadian tour, in 
				support of their new album Let The Bad Times Roll, will take place in Halifax. This time around they’re 
				accompanied by Canadian pop-punk band Simple Plan. This show, taking place in the Scotiabank Center, will be 
				one of the first in Halifax since the beginning of the COVID-19 lockdown began in March 2020, bringing a nice 
				breath of fresh air back to the music scene.</p>

				<h2>Featured Electronic Artist:</h2>
				<h2 class="caravanTitle">Caravan Palace</h2>
				<p>Caravan Palace is an electro swing band from Paris, France, formed in 2006. The founding trio, Arnaud "Vial" 
				de Bosredon, Charles Delaporte, and Hugues Payen met while composing the soundtrack for a silent adult film. 
				After playing together, a producer took an interest in them and booked the band a recording studio and a set of 
				gigs. For performing live, they needed more members, so three others were recruited to help them play live 
				during their shows. Although they were active from 2006, it wasn’t until 2008 when they released their first 
				studio album, a self-titled record. The group became very popular in Europe, but their popularity exploded even 
				more with the release of the song Lone Digger in 2015, as a single for their <|°_°|> album. They are one of, if 
				not the most, well-known names in the electro swing scene, and for good reason.</p>
				<p>During the past fifteen years, the group has put out four studio albums and three EPs. Their most popular 
				record was definitely their <|°_°|> album, released in late 2015. This was due to the album being promoted by the 
				single Lone Digger. It is easily their most popular song, boasting over 130 million streams on Spotify. This year, 
				the band was also featured in virtual reality rhythm game Synth Riders, which is a rhythm game mostly focused on 
				synthwave, swing, electronic, and punk. Thus, Caravan Palace being a combination of both electronic and swing were 
				a perfect fit for the game. They were given their own song pack as downloadable content, containing the songs Lone 
				Digger, Miracle, Rock It For Me, Tattoos, and Wonderland. Wonderland came with what the game calls an “Experience”, 
				where the game’s traditional stages are replaced for what is essentially a virtual reality movie or experience of 
				the song. There are animations that happen around the player that represent and are related to the theme and tone of 
				the song. With the growth of virtual reality thanks to the Quest 2, the release of this DLC bundle also boosted the 
				band’s popularity a significant amount.</p>
